Question1: 
-Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program2, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?

Answer:
-Program2 (Parallel Streams) has significantly better performance than Program1 (Producer-Consumer with ForkJoinPool). In testing, Program2 completes execution in about 2 seconds, while Program1 takes around 8.5 seconds. This is because Program2 processes all tasks (download, analyze, categorize) in a single pass, efficiently distributing work using ForkJoinPoolâ€™s work-stealing mechanism. In contrast, Program1 processes tasks in separate stages using BlockingQueues, which introduces synchronization overhead and delays between stages. As a result, Program2 achieves better efficiency and faster execution.

Question2: 
-Is there any difference in which order different work tasks are performed in the two
different solutions, Program1 and Program2?

Answer:
-The order of execution differs between the two programs. Program1 follows a strict stage-by-stage process where all webpages are first downloaded, then analyzed, and finally categorized. Each stage must wait for the previous one to finish, leading to potential bottlenecks. In contrast, Program2 processes each webpage independently through all stages in a continuous pipeline, meaning some pages may be categorized while others are still downloading. This approach allows Program2 to work more efficiently without unnecessary delays.

Question3: 
-Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program3, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?

Answer:
-Program1 (ForkJoinPool) has better performance than Program3 (MyExecutor) because ForkJoinPool uses work-stealing, allowing idle threads to dynamically pick up tasks, leading to better load balancing and reduced idle time. In contrast, MyExecutor relies on a fixed-thread pool with a blocking queue, which can cause unnecessary waiting and slightly higher execution time. The performance difference is small, around 1 second, but ForkJoinPool is more efficient in handling parallel tasks.
